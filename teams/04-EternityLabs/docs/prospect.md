## **Market positioning and research**

**The market localization**

​	Eternity Network is a decentralized quantization protocol initiated by Eternity Labs. Its market positioning is to provide quantified services for polkadot Ecology. Eternity Network will provide open source, secure and stable quantified asset services for the entire encryption market.At the same time for the entire Web 3.0 world to provide more convenient data analysis, AI algorithm services. The existence of Eternity Network will greatly reduce the difficulty of data analysis on the blockchain.

**The market research**

​	There are also several players in the blockchain quantification space trying to quantify digital assets, often in a centralized manner. Users need to authorize the private and public keys of their exchanges, which has its own risks.

​	The API3 public chain provides a network of prophets and governs the network through DAO and Kleros.API3 builds a network of predictors by handing them over to the data source provider to run, and provides cross-chain aggregation data for DAPPs.

​	BitQuery is a blockchain data engine. By aggregating the data on the blockchain chain, BitQuery provides the data API on the blockchain chain to the users, and also provides the simple data analysis capability on the blockchain chain and GraphQl API.

​	Eternity Network is the only basic application service that provides easier, safer, and more reliable quantification, analysis, and modeling for the entire polkadot ecosystem.
